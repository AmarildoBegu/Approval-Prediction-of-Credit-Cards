# Approval-Prediction-of-Credit-Cards. In this project we have a dataset of credit cards and we need to predict which ones will be aproved so that we can target those that will be approved. We will do some Exploratory Data Analytics (EDA), Vizualization, Merging dataframes, Feature Selection, Machine learning and Validation. For ML we will use Logistic Regresion, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, K Nearest Neighbor (KNN) and XGBoost! At the end will choose the best model to predict. Thank You!
